[GSmartControl](https://gsmartcontrol.shaduri.dev)
is a graphical user interface for smartctl (from [smartmontools](https://www.smartmontools.org/)

querying and controlling [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Monitoring,_Analysis_and_Reporting_Technology)
(Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting
Technology) data on modern hard disk and solid-state drives. It allows you to
inspect the drive's SMART data to determine its health, as well as run various
tests on it.
