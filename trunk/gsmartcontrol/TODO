GTKMM Notes:

To transfer an ownership from your local code to a container, use
Gtk::Button* pButton = Gtk::manage(new Gtk::Button("Test"));
container->add(*pButton);
(add() takes an object by reference).
otherwise, you will need to delete() it.

local scope destruction also works if using stack variables.
{
	Gtk::Button aButton;
	// destroyed here
}

TODO:

-l defects support? (smartctl 6.6)


Don't rely on smartctl return code (2), parse the output instead.
	This will allow us to show the Info page.
	Need usage cases.
	JSON may fix this.


GTKMM 4.
	GtkFileChooserNative
		scoped_ptr (after GtkFileChooserNative)
	GTK_CHECK_VERSION, GTKMM_CHECK_VERSION
	port rconfig/autosave.h from glib to glibmm.
	local_glibmm.h
	APP_GTKMM_CONNECT_VIRTUAL ?
	make dpi-aware?

JSON.
	Port the rest to std::regex, get rid of pcre requirement.
		Not sure, we still want to support old-format files.
		Maybe make pcre optional (only for parsing the old format)

Port to std::filesystem (gcc 8; mingw not yet supported).
	remove i18n.h
	Can use experimental/filesystem (no fstream support yet).

res_data.h - port to static string_view, maybe simplify?
	maybe remove compile-time support?

Use std::from_chars() in string_is_numeric_impl_classic_locale() (gcc 8)

Mark with gettext

Fix win32 crash.

Check if we need to distribute MIT license.


Check TODOs





Testing:
	If ETA time has elapsed, but it's still only at 10% completion,
		ETA 0 is displayed. Fix.
	Detect running tests on launch (maybe ask the user too? some tests
		may be stuck due to bad firmware, e.g. 3ware/windows).
	If smartctl outputs gibberish while testing, the GUI hangs.


Support RAID for these controllers (supported by smartctl 6.5):
	https://www.smartmontools.org/wiki/Supported_RAID-Controllers

	Adaptec (Windows, Linux using "-d aacraid")
	HighPoint RocketRAID (Linux, FreeBSD (analyze sent info))
	LSI MegaRAID (Linux, FreeBSD)
	3ware (FreeBSD)
	Areca (FreeBSD)
	HP CCISS (FreeBSD)
