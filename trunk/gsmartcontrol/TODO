GTKMM Notes:

To transfer an ownership from your local code to a container, use
Gtk::Button* pButton = Gtk::manage(new Gtk::Button("Test"));
container->add(*pButton);
(add() takes an object by reference).
otherwise, you will need to delete() it.

local scope destruction also works if using stack variables.
{
	Gtk::Button aButton;
	// destroyed here
}

TODO:

-l defects support? (smartctl 6.6)


Don't rely on smartctl return code (2), parse the output instead.
	This will allow us to show the Info page.
	Need usage cases.
	JSON may fix this.


Port to C++17 (or at least 14, that's what libsigc++ requires)
	Remove glibmm thread stuff (it's gone in gtkmm4).


strtold / strtof, DISABLE_STRTOF, DISABLE_STRTOLD (after ascii.h)
Port to std::filesystem.
type_properties.h / type_categories.h (after ascii.h and string_num.h)
scoped_ptr (after we have GtkFileChooserNative in gtkmm)
scoped_array (after we get rid of hz::fs)
Fix ResourceDataAnyDumper.
sync.
common_types (after sync).
format_date() -> C++17 has it.
noncopyable (after sync)
snprintf
ptr_container
stream_cast?
some string_algo
string_sprintf?
wcmatch (through regex)?
std::wstring in mingw instead of wchar_t?
Check licenses - do we still use boost, bsd?


After JSON:
	Port to std::regex, get rid of pcre requirement.







Testing:
	If ETA time has elapsed, but it's still only at 10% completion,
		ETA 0 is displayed. Fix.
	Detect running tests on launch (maybe ask the user too? some tests
		may be stuck due to bad firmware, e.g. 3ware/windows).
	If smartctl outputs gibberish while testing, the GUI hangs.


Support RAID for these controllers (supported by smartctl 6.5):
	https://www.smartmontools.org/wiki/Supported_RAID-Controllers

	Adaptec (Windows, Linux using "-d aacraid")
	HighPoint RocketRAID (Linux, FreeBSD (analyze sent info))
	LSI MegaRAID (Linux, FreeBSD)
	3ware (FreeBSD)
	Areca (FreeBSD)
	HP CCISS (FreeBSD)
