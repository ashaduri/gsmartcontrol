This directory contains scripts and an example crontab to allow GSmartControl
to read smartctl data from cron-generated files. This allows users to read
somewhat recent smartctl information without having to run GSmartControl as
root.

Put the scripts into /usr/local/bin, run GSmartControl and set smartctl path
to "/usr/local/bin/smartctl_subst.sh" (without quotes). An example crontab
runs cron_gather_smart.sh script every 10 minutes, storing its output to
"/var/run/smart-$devname". The smartctl_subst.sh script prints the contents of
this file instead of running smartctl, thus eliminating the need to run
GSmartControl as root when reading SMART values.

Note: These scripts provide read-only capabilities only, they don't allow
changing SMART settings or running self-tests.
