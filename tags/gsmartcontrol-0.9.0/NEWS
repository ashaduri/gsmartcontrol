		and hpsa/hpahcisr drivers (thanks to Fabrice Bacchella).
	Changes in Preferences no longer fail silently until rescan/restart.
	Better drive detection under Windows after removable drives are detached.
	Windows version is no longer marked as "dpi aware" since it's not
		supported that well.

		for SSDs).
	Added support for SSD-only and HDD-only vendor attributes.

		detection under Linux (untested).
	Implemented support for systems with several different 3ware controllers
		(twa/twe/twl).
	Fixed invalid parsing of tw_cli output which caused non-detection of
		drives and controllers with controller or port numbers greater than 9
		if tw_cli was found (3ware linux, windows).

		under Windows; Intel RAID controllers are fully supported under

		including tw_cli/cx/px mode in Windows. Having tw_cli is recommended
		but not required.
	Added support for specifying -d option and extra parameters via command
		line, "Add Device" and "Preferences" dialogs. This change effectively
		adds full support for multiple drives behind a single device name.
	Beesu and su-to-root are supported by gsmartcontrol-root script now.
	Completely revamped the attribute database and its handling, should be a
		lot more usable and forward-compatible now; SSD attributes are also

		migrated automatically.
	The names are shown correctly for unsupported devices even with the latest
		smartctl snapshots now.

	Fixed compilation under very old gtkmm/libglademm, and with gcc 4.4.
	Fixed parsing of multiple error types in SMART error log.

		smartctl information without having to run GSmartControl as root.
		Generously contributed by Alex Butcher <alex dot butcher 'at'
		assursys.co.uk>.
	Configure script correctly aborts instead of printing a warning if gtkmm
		or libglademm (if needed) is not found.
	Configure script now accepts --enable-windows-console,
		--disable-abort-if-no-gtkmm, --disable-abort-if-no-glade-reader,
		as well as Windows-supporting "auto" for --enable-nsis-wine and
		--with-nsis.

		control file conflicts with Build Service).
	Renamed gsmartcontrol_root.sh to gsmartcontrol-root, to make Debian happy.
