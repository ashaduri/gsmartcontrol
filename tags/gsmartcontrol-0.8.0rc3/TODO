GTKMM Notes:

To transfer an ownership from your local code to a container, use
Gtk::Button* pButton = Gtk::manage(new Gtk::Button("Test"));
container->add(*pButton);
(add() takes an object by reference).
otherwise, you will need to delete() it.

local scope destruction also works if using stack variables.
{
	Gtk::Button aButton;
	// destroyed here
}


A treeview (also iconview, combobox) from glade comes
with existing model, which should be unset


--------------------------------------------------------

GTKMM problems:


Lots of gtk_, GTK_, g_ in documentation.


no ComboBox::unset_model()  and IconView::unset_model().

TODO:
	if -q is passed, Execution log doesn't contain libdebug log. fix.


Drive detection - any cross-platform way to do it?


FreeBSD: /dev/ad[0-3], partitions - /dev/ad[]
http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/handbook/disks-naming.html
Non-existent devices give ENXIO (6, Device not configured).
	In Linux ENXIO has name (6, No such device or address).
/dev/ad0s1b             none            swap    sw              0       0
/dev/ad0s1a             /               ufs     rw              1       1
/dev/acd0c              /cdrom          cd9660  ro,noauto       0       0
Do NOT open cd devices - it may cause hang on music cd, etc... .

In the slice case the drive will be added as /dev/da1s1e. This is read as:
SCSI disk, unit number 1 (second SCSI disk), slice 1 (PC BIOS partition 1),
and e BSD partition. In the dedicated case, the drive will be added simply as /dev/da1e.


iphone:
	/dev/disk0
	/dev/disk0s1, /dev/disk0s2




desktop files: gnomesu / gtksu wrapper.
desktop_other - find suitable su.




----------- Feature List ----------

+Autodetect available devices (through /proc / /sys ?).
	win32 support for autodetection (what about different smartctl drivers?).

+Select current device (from autodetected list; manually whitelist devices).

+Smartctl binary (text entries in Options - binary, default command line options).
+	Global command-line options for smartctl.
+	Command-line options per-device in settings (e.g. -d ata).
+	Search smartctl binary on startup (try to execute it with --version). If it's not there, alert the user.

+Indicate which of the devices has SMART supported / enabled.
+	Enable / disable smart on devices.
+		Indicate that this is until shutdown (but may be preserved on reboot).
+	Direct them to smartd / smartctl documentation for permanent enabling.
+		NOTE: SMART is sometimes preserved across power cycles.

+Enable / disable Automatic Offline Data Collection for devices. (-o on)
+	Show its status in the main window.

+Show identity information for device (aka short info), --info.

+Show all SMART information for device (--all), includes:
+	* Short info (--info)
+	* SMART DATA
+		* overall-health (-H, --health) - may check this automatically as well.
+		* General SMART Values, aka Capabilities (-c, --capabilities)
+		* Attributes (-A, --attributes). These need decoding.
+		* Error Log (-l error)
+		* Self-test log (-l selftest)
+		* Selective self-test log and settings
		* SCT status and other stuff
			Display temperature somewhere (use SCT or Attr 194 for this).
			Which one is updated more frequently, SCT or attr 194?
+	* Ability to save this information to a file.
+	* On info window show: Ask to turn SMART on if it's disabled

+Program error reporting:
+	invalid smartmontools version.
+	cannot parse output - show log.
+	smartctl exited with error - look it up in error map.


SCT Temperatures (do we use these?)
	-l scttemp prints temperature and history.
	-t scttempint,N[,p] (N - count, p - preserve across reset or not).
		This configures temperature logging interval (1 min by default) and clears the history.


Tests:
	Ability to detect a testing drive on boot, show its info with testing tab.

	Run one-time Immediate Offline test (-t offline).
		Offline tests only update Attributes, and if errors are found they will
		appear in SMART error log. Self-test logs are unaffected.
		Abort (-X). Abort works with Offline only if there's
		"Abort Offline collection upon new command" capability.
		If the drive has "Suspend Offline collection upon new  command" capability,
		immediate offline test may be tracked through --capabilities (not on mine!).
		If it's "Abort Offline collection upon new command", then the test
		will abort on --capabilities or --abort.


Polling time
The self-test routine recommended polling time shall be equal to the number of minutes that is the minimum
recommended time before which the host should first poll for test completion status. Actual test time could
be several times this value. Polling before this time could extend the self-test execution time or abort the test
depending on the state of bit 2 of the off-line data capability bits.

Autosave
This command enables and disables the optional attribute autosave feature of the device. This command
may either allow the device, after some vendor specified event, to save the device updated attribute values
to non-volatile memory; or this command may cause the autosave feature to be disabled. The state of the
attribute autosave feature (either enabled or disabled) shall be preserved by the device across power cycles.
A value of zero written by the host into the device’s Sector Count register before issuing this command shall
cause this feature to be disabled. Disabling this feature does not preclude the device from saving SMART
data to non-volatile memory during some other normal operation such as during a power-on or power-off
sequence or during an error recovery sequence.
A value of F1h written by the host into the device’s Sector Count register before issuing this command shall
cause this feature to be enabled. Any other meaning of this value or any other non-zero value written by the
host into this register before issuing this command may differ from device to device. The meaning of any
non-zero value written to this register at this time shall be preserved by the device across power cycles.
