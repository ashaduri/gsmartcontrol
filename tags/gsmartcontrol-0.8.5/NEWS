Version 0.8.5, released on 2009-09-05
	GSmartControl now uses XDG config directory for per-user configuration on
		UNIX and CSIDL_PROFILE directory on Windows. Existing configuration is
		migrated automatically.
	The names are shown correctly for unsupported devices even with the latest
		smartctl snapshots now.
	Smartctl SVN revision is shown (if available).
	The progress bars update properly when parallel tests are run.
	Windows: GSmartControl should be able to operate on any valid filesystem
		path (not just locale-representable ones).
	Windows: GSmartControl is now officially compilable on x86_64 via mingw64.
	Fixed compilation under very old gtkmm/libglademm, and with gcc 4.4.
	Fixed parsing of multiple error types in SMART error log.
	Added minor features and fixed miscellaneous bugs.

Version 0.8.4, released on 2009-03-23
	Linux Software RAID devices are blacklisted now. (backported from Debian).
	Attributes tab is before the capabilities tab now.
	A man page has been generously contributed by Giuseppe Iuculano
		<giuseppe@iuculano.it>.
	Smartctl version now includes the CVS snapshot date (if available).
	Windows: Look for "smartctl-nc.exe" instead of "smartctl.exe" by default.
	Windows: Use smartmontools-supplied smartctl-nc.exe by default (if found).
	Other minor changes (mainly Debian backports).

Version 0.8.3, released on 2008-12-27
	A random "Smartctl returned an empty output" error on Windows was fixed.
		Thanks to Zurab Khetsuriani for testing.
	Fixed a parser issue which prevented running self-tests in Windows.
	The supplied icon (hopefully) shows correctly in Windows 2000 now.
	This release adds an official support for Windows 2000 SP4.
	Added scripts to allow GSmartControl to read smartctl data from
		cron-generated files. This allows users to read somewhat recent
		smartctl information without having to run GSmartControl as root.
		Generously contributed by Alex Butcher <alex dot butcher 'at'
		assursys.co.uk>.
	Configure script correctly aborts instead of printing a warning if gtkmm
		or libglademm (if needed) is not found.
	Configure script now accepts --enable-windows-console,
		--disable-abort-if-no-gtkmm, --disable-abort-if-no-glade-reader,
		as well as Windows-supporting "auto" for --enable-nsis-wine and
		--with-nsis.
	Configure's --with-win32-env has been renamed to --with-windows-dlls.
	The "About" dialog shows version information now.
	Minor bugs were fixed.

Version 0.8.2, released on 2008-12-10
	Fixed gsmartcontrol_root.sh script to support distributions with no
		/usr/sbin in their users' paths (thanks to Erwan Velu).
	Added desktop auto-detection to gsmartcontrol_root.sh script. This allows
		us to use only one desktop file (thanks to Erwan Velu).
	Added Debian package directory (named "debian.dist" for now to avoid
		control file conflicts with Build Service).
	Renamed gsmartcontrol_root.sh to gsmartcontrol-root, to make Debian happy.
	Added make targets for Windows packages (zip and NSIS).
	Fixed Windows-related issues (Vista is fully supported now).
	Fixed minor bugs:
		Smartctl parser is win32-locale-aware now.
		No more unnecessary parsing.
		No segfault on exit under Windows and Solaris.
		A friendlier message is displayed if smartctl was not found.
		No highlighted labels when switching tabs in Information window.

		systems.
