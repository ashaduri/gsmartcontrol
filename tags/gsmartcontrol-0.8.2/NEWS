Version 0.8.2, released on 2008-12-10
	Fixed gsmartcontrol_root.sh script to support distributions with no
		/usr/sbin in their users' paths (thanks to Erwan Velu).
	Added desktop auto-detection to gsmartcontrol_root.sh script. This allows
		us to use only one desktop file (thanks to Erwan Velu).
	Added debian package directory (named "debian.dist" for now to avoid
		control file conflicts with Build Service).
	Renamed gsmartcontrol_root.sh to gsmartcontrol-root, to make Debian happy.
	Added make targets for Windows packages (zip and NSIS).
	Fixed Windows-related issues (Vista is fully supported now).
	Fixed minor bugs:
		Smartctl parser is win32-locale-aware now.
		No more unnecessary parsing.
		No segfault on exit under Windows and Solaris.
		A friendlier message is displayed if smartctl was not found.
		No hilighted labels when switching tabs in Information window.

	Added an icon and resource file for Windows.
